# UnderTheHood
Summer project that I did under Programming Club, IITK. The aim of the project was to understand how data is stored in computers and how they perform basic functions.
I also learnt about Verilog and Assembly Language.

The final phase of the project required us to implement a Simple Calculator in MIPS Assembly Language. It has following functionalities on integers.

1. Addition (+)
2. Subtraction (-)
3. Multiplication (*)
4. Division (/)
5. Modulus (%)
The calculator takes a single integer at a time followed by an operator. Then it takes a second integer and prints the current answer. The calculator will perform the operations till '=' operator is encountered or an error occurs.
